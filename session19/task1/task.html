                    Hi,
                    I'm Rohit Vikas Waghmare, and I'm a student currently pursuing engineering at MIT in Aurangabad.
                    I'm really interested in technology,
                    and I've taken several courses on web development and application development using Flutter to keep
                    up with the latest advancements in the field.
                    In addition to my programming skills, I also have a passion for design, and I've spent a lot of time
                    honing my skills in Figma.
                    I really enjoy the creative problem-solving that comes with designing something both aesthetically
                    pleasing and functional.
                </p>
                <p id="info2">

                    Outside of academics,
                    I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, reading books,
                    and exploring new technology trends. I'm really excited to see how I can apply my skills and interests in the future,
                    and I'm eager to make a significant impact in the field and beyond.
